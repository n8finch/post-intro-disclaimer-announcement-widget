Place a disclaimer widget into a custom widget area, which will display on all posts or in specific categories.

## Description ==
Use this plugin to place a disclaimer widget into a custom widget area, which will display on all posts or in specific categories.

After activating the plugin, you will find a new widget area and a new widget available in the Appearance>>Widgets section of your WordPress admin. Both the new widget and widget area are called \"Post Intro Disclaimer Announcements\" (hereafter PIDA). Drag the new PIDA widget to the new PIDA widget area. Once it is in the widget area, you can add content to the text area and select the colors you want to use.

The PIDA widget comes with default highlight, text color and background color settings. If you change the colors, save, and want to revert to the defaults, just delete the current colors in the input fields, and upon saving, the widget will revert the colors to the defaults.

If you have any questions, suggestions or would like to report a bug, you can do so at the plugin\'s repo on GitHub by opening a new issue: https://github.com/n8finch/post-intro-disclaimer-announcement-widget/issues
